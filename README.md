# Elevvo-projects
Elevvo pathways internship project, where I have done four real world machine learning projects

**#Customer Segmentation**
This project focuses on grouping customers into meaningful segments based on their annual income and spending score using unsupervised learning techniques. The workflow includes data scaling, exploratory visualization, and applying K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior. The optimal number of clusters is determined through methods like the Elbow and Silhouette scores, followed by clear 2D visualizations that highlight distinct customer groups. These insights can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall decision-making.

**#Forest-Type Classifier**
This project focuses on predicting the type of forest cover based on cartographic and environmental features such as elevation, slope, aspect, soil type, and wilderness area. Using machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, the model classifies seven forest cover types from the well-known Forest Cover Type dataset. The goal is to compare model performance, identify key environmental factors influencing forest type, and build a reliable multi-class classification pipeline using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and XGBoost.

**#Music-Genre Classification**
This project aims to classify songs into different music genres using the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle. Audio data is preprocessed by extracting features such as MFCCs, chroma, and by converting audio signals into spectrogram images for visual analysis. Depending on the data representation, either a machine learning model (for tabular features) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (for image-based input) is trained and evaluated. The goal is to accurately predict the genre of a song based on its audio characteristics, demonstrating the power of feature extraction and deep learning in audio classification.

**#Traffic-Sign Recognition**
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2) to automatically classify traffic signs from the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset. The workflow includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, performance evaluation interface for real-time prediction. The goal is to enable accurate and efficient detection of traffic signs for potential use in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.
